If you'd like to publicly show that you're attending one of our meetups then it's now possible to submit an RSVP by [webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) to our website.

Firstly you need a post or page on your website which has some specific snippets of HTML:

1. An [h-card](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) with your name, website address and avatar.
2. An RSVP section including the URL of the event page on Tonbridge.digital and a response of "yes" if attending. All of this is normally contained within an [h-entry](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) snippet. **Please note we filter out any other responses**.
3. Upload/push your webpage wherever it's hosted, then submit a webmention.
4. To submit a webmention either create your own submission tool or use a hosted solution like [Telegraph](https://telegraph.p3k.io/send-a-webmention). *Depending on your setup you might be able to combine the last two steps as one process*
