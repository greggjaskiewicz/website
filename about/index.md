Tonbridge is located in the heart of West Kent with a thriving town thanks to a wide range of retail, leisure and residential options for a range of budgets.

We are here to help promote and bring together small businesses and individuals throughout Tonbridge looking to embrace a digital strategy going forward. We organise social events and this website as a platform to communicate what's happening here:

* Businesses and individuals with an online presence
* Those seeking assistance to gain an online presence
* Educating young and old in using technology
* Automating tasks in your business through digital technology
* Technology jobs in Tonbridge

With its close proximity to the country's technology hub in London we are well placed to attract nearby talent and offer an attractive alternative that makes Tonbridge more than a commuter location but a place to work, play and live in.
